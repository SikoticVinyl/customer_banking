# Banking Account Interest Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple banking account interest calculator that helps users calculate the interest earned on savings and CD accounts over a specified period. The application was built to demonstrate basic programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, user input handling, and error handling. It solves the problem of manually calculating interest and updating account balances, making it easier for users to manage their finances. Through this project, I learned how to structure a Python project, handle user inputs robustly, and implement basic financial calculations.

## Features

- Calculates interest for both savings and CD accounts.
- Handles user inputs and errors gracefully.
- Provides formatted output for better readability.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed. This project requires Python 3.10.14

## Usage

1. Run the `customer_banking.py` script to start the application.
    ```bash
    python customer_banking.py
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to enter the savings account balance, interest rate, and the number of months. The program will calculate and display the interest earned and the updated balance.

3. Follow the prompts to enter the CD account balance, interest rate, and the number of months. The program will similarly calculate and display the interest earned and the updated balance.

### Example

```
Enter the savings account balance: 1000
Enter the savings account interest rate: 5
Enter the number of months for the savings account: 12
The interest earned on the savings account is: $50.00
The updated savings account balance is: $1050.00
This is the updated balance after 12 months with an interest rate of 5%

Enter the CD account balance: 2000
Enter the CD account interest rate: 3
Enter the number of months for the CD account: 6
The interest earned on the CD account is: $30.00
The updated CD account balance is: $2030.00
This is the updated balance after 6 months with an interest rate of 3%
```
